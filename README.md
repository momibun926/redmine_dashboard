Redmine Dashboard 3 is a full rewrite of the [stable Redmine Dashboard 2](https://github.com/jgraichen/redmine_dashboard/tree/stable-v2). Redmine Dashboard 3 is pre-alpha. As of now you cannot even drag issues.

## Install v3 pre-alpha

As Redmine Dashboard 3 is still pre-alpha it can only build from source. You need Ruby, NodeJS with NPM, bower and make.

Clone repository and install NPM and bower dependencies:

	$ git clone git@github.com:jgraichen/redmine_dashboard.git -b master
	$ make install

Compile development or production (minified) client-side components:

	$ make css js # development
	$ make min # production

Install redmine plugin like any redmine plugin

	$ bundle install
	$ rake redmine:plugins:migrate

### Translate

You can help even without coding by translating Redmine Dashboard or improving an existing localization. I prefer translations via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/organization/redmine_dashboard/dashboard/redmine-dashboard) but also gladly accept Pull Requests for the YAML files.

### Features

You can also add a new or requested feature by sending a Pull Request. Please add specs so that I do not break your feature in the future.

There are several rake and make tasks to setup a working development environment and run all specs. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) of more information.
